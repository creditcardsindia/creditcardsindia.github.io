# Credit Cards India

Welcome to the **Credit Cards India** repository, a space dedicated to building innovative open-source applications for managing and exploring credit card-related information in India. This repository is aimed at fostering a community-driven approach to develop tools, databases, and projects that benefit credit card users, enthusiasts, and developers.

## Vision

Our vision is to build open-source, user-friendly, and impactful applications that help people make informed financial decisions, optimize their credit card usage, and keep track of their financial health. We aim to create a vibrant ecosystem of open-source projects that cater to the evolving needs of the Indian credit card landscape.

We are committed to building meaningful software that is accessible, transparent, and free to use, while also enabling collaboration and contributions from developers around the world.

## Upcoming Projects

Here are some of the exciting projects we are working on:

### Lounge Track
**Lounge Track** is an app designed to help users manage and track their credit card lounge access benefits. Many premium credit cards offer free access to airport lounges, but it can be hard to keep track of the available lounges, access conditions, and usage limits. Lounge Track aims to simplify this by providing a central hub for users to find, manage, and track their lounge privileges.

### Credit Card Database
**Credit Card Database** will be a comprehensive, open-source database of all credit cards available in India. The database will include details like:
- Reward points
- Cashback offers
- Annual fees
- Interest rates
- Lounge access
- Other benefits

It will help users compare different credit cards, find the best deals, and make informed decisions when choosing a card.

### And Many More...
Our journey doesn't stop here. We have a series of exciting projects in the pipeline, including:
- Credit card bill management tools
- Finance tracking apps
- Integrations with popular banking APIs -If They are to allow Open Source
- Financial literacy resources and tools
